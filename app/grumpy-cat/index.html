    <h3>Grumpy cat</h3>
    Tardar Sauce (born April 4, 2012),[1] commonly known as Grumpy Cat, is a cat Internet and media personality and actress. She is known for her permanently "grumpy" facial appearance, which is caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism.[2][3][4] She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha, in September 2012,[2][5] and lolcats and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit users went viral. She is the subject of a popular internet meme in which negative lolcats (such as "I Had Fun Once... It Was Awful") are made from photographs of her.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    Tardar Sauce was one of a litter of four kittens born to a calico mother and a father of an unknown breed at the home of her owner, Tabatha Bundesen.[6][7] The Bundesens say that Tardar Sauce's face appears grumpy because the feline has a form of dwarfism. She and her brother Pokey were born to normal parents with "a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail".[8] Tardar Sauce is undersized and has hind legs that "are a bit different".[2][4] Although she has a "grumpy" appearance and is called "Grumpy Cat", according to the Bundesens, 99% of the time she is a "normal kitty".

    Ben Lashes is Grumpy Cat's manager who also represents Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat.[10][11] Tabatha Bundesen took a leave of absence from her day job at Red Lobster to manage Grumpy Cat's schedule while Bryan Bundesen manages the Grumpy Cat website, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts.

    <h3>Media appearances</h3>
    Photo sessions are only once a week, and handling by strangers is limited.[2] At South by Southwest Interactive, Tardar Sauce made limited two-hour appearances each day as Grumpy Cat, bringing about world peace and free cookies.[14]

    Grumpy Cat has appeared on NBC News's Today,[15] ABC News's Good Morning America,[16] CBS Evening News, Anderson Live,[17] VH1's Big Morning Buzz Live, The Soup[18] and FOX's American Idol.

    In March 2013, Grumpy Cat attended SXSW Interactive, hosted at the Mashable House.[4][5][23] Friskies paid travel expenses to Austin in order to film "Will Kitty Play With It?"[13][24] CNN, CBS, and CNET called Grumpy Cat the undisputed "biggest star" of SXSW Interactive over Elon Musk, Al Gore, and Neil Gaiman.[5][25][26] Over 600[27] fans, including Dennis Crowley, waited for hours in the line, which was nearly three blocks long, to take a photo.[4][5][28] Ian Somerhalder took photos with Grumpy Cat and called her "my new love", "very peaced out", "sweet as pumpkin pie", and "kind of amazing".

    In October 2016, Grumpy Cat made a special appearance on Disney Channel's 'Bizaardvark'.[34]

    <h3>Friskies sponsorship</h3>
    Grumpy Cat appeared in episodes of the Friskies YouTube game show "Will Kitty Play With It?"[4][24][35][36] In September 2013, it was announced that Grumpy Cat would become the Official Spokescat of Friskies.[37] TMZ reported that Friskies paid for flying first class, a private hotel room with king-sized bed, a personal assistant, a chauffeur, and unlimited Friskies food and bottled water.[24] On March 22, 2013, Grumpy Cat traveled to New York City promoting the show and appeared on Good Morning America[16] and Anderson Live[17] and visited Time for a photoshoot.[27] Michael Noer "interviewed" Grumpy Cat for Forbes, released March 25.[38]

    <h3>Merchandising</h3>
    According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office database, "Grumpy Cat Limited" applied to trademark "Grumpy Cat" and an image of her at the end of January 2013.[39] Licensed merchandise like t-shirts and mugs are advertised on the website and sold at Hot Topic.[2][10] Stuffed toys are also available, the official plush being produced by Gund.[40] Ganz, the company behind Webkinz, also has a small Grumpy Cat plush which allows for anyone to play with her on their Webkinz page.[41] There are also various key chains and unofficial plushes produced. Bryan said that by March 2013 they earned "mid-five figures"[5] and "low-six-figure" by May 2013.[13] The company has an estimated value of $1 million.[12] Grenade Beverage LLC makes Grumpy Cat "Grumppuccino" iced coffee beverages.[13][42][43] In December 2015, Grumpy Cat, Ltd. sued Grenade Beverage over trademark infringement when the beverage company expanded its line of Grumpy Cat coffees; however, Grenade contends the suit is without merit.[44]
